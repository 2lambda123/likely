### The Big Idea
Likely is a Lisp-inspired programming language / file format for serializing image recognition models.
Storing both the inference algorithm and the model parameters together in a Likely source file allows the model to be executed on operating systems and hardware architectures not supported by the machine learning framework used to generate it.

### License
Likely is offered under **[Apache 2.0](LICENSE.txt)**, meaning it's *free for academic and commercial use*.
