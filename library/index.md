### The Big Idea
Likely formulates statistical learning as the compile-time evalutation of a function (the learning algorithm) with constant arguments (the training data).

### Principles
 - Effective syntax for pattern recognition and image processing.
 - Embeddable into other projects and languages.
 - Immediate visual feedback during algorithm development.
 - Heterogeneous hardware architecture support.
 - Free open source software.

### Background
The software engineering of a complex system is often facilitated by a _Domain Specific Language_ (DSL) whose syntax is designed to efficiently solve problems encountered in the domain.
While many technical communities rely on DSLs, there exists no popular specialized language for image recognition.
As a consequence, current algorithm development practices fail to simultaneously respect human time and creativity, and hardware capacity and diversity.
We believe a just-in-time DSL for image recognition is necessary to invent algorithms too complex, inefficient, or otherwise impossible to express in today's static and dynamic languages.

### License
Likely is offered under **[Apache 2.0](LICENSE.txt)**, meaning it's *free for academic and commercial use*.
