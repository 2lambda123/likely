### The Big Idea
Likely is a Lisp-inspired file format for serializing image recognition models.
Storing both the inference algorithm and the model parameters together in a Likely file separates the machine learning framework for generating the model from the computing devices executing the model.

### License
Likely is offered under **[Apache 2.0](LICENSE.txt)**, meaning it's *free for academic and commercial use*.
