Code
----
Actual Likely code is written in **[Lua](http://www.lua.org/)**. Reading **[Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)** is a great way to learn Lua if you are unfamiliar with the language.

This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of Lua and focuses on concepts specific to Likely. Nevertheless, it is hoped that even users entirely new to Lua will find it accessible.
