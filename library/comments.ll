Comments
--------
Likely uses **[Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)** syntax.
Code is specified in blocks like:

    x = 9
    ; This is an inline comment that goes to the end of the line

or

```
y = x * 4
```

or `z = y + 6` `(z)`.
Everything outside a code block is a comment!
