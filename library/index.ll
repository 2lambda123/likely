### Principles
 - Efficient syntax for image processing and pattern recognition.
 - Embeddable into other projects and languages.
 - Immediate visual feedback during algorithm development.
 - Heterogeneous hardware architecture support.
 - Free open source software.

### Background
The software engineering of a complex system is often facilitated by a _Domain Specific Language_ (DSL) whose syntax is designed to efficiently solve problems encountered in the domain.
While many technical communities rely on DSLs, **there exists no language specialized for image recognition**.
As a consequence, current algorithm development practices fail to simultaneously respect human time and creativity, and hardware capacity and diversity.
We believe **a just-in-time DSL for image recognition is necessary to invent algorithms currently too complex, inefficient, or otherwise impossible to express in today's static and dynamic languages.**
