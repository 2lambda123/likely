Likely
======
Likely comes with a console/interpreter/compiler called **likely**:

```bash
$ likely --help                     # to bring up usage help
$ likely                            # to enter a read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) shell
$ likely <input file>               # to execute a likely source file as a script
$ likely <input file> <output file> # to compile a likely source file to assembly
```

Try running [hello world](?show=hello_world) through it:

```bash
$ likely ../library/hello_world.ll
```
