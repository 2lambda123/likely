Comments
--------
Likely uses **[Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)**. Code is specified in blocks like:

    x = 9
    -- This is a single line comment in a code block

or

```
y = 4*x
```

or `z = y+6` `show(z)`. Everything outside a code block is a comment!
