Arithmetic
----------

    lenna = read("../data/misc/lenna.tiff")

Saturation arithmetic is part of the type system

    lenna.saturation = true

Likely will automatically apply operations to all elements in a matrix

```
added = lenna + 32
subtracted = lenna - 32
multiplied = lenna * 2
divided = lenna / 2
```
