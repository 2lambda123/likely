Likely comes with an compiler/interpreter called **like**:

```bash
$ like --help                     # to bring up usage help
$ like                            # to enter a read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) shell
$ like <input file>               # to execute a likely source file as a script
$ like <input file> <output file> # to compile a likely source file to assembly
```

Try running [hello world](?show=hello_world) through it:

```bash
$ like library/hello_world.ll
```
