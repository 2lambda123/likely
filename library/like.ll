Likely comes with an compiler/interpreter called **like**:

```bash
$ like --help        # to bring up usage help
$ like               # to enter a read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) shell
$ like <source_file> # to execute a likely source file
```

Try running [hello world](?show=hello_world) through it:

```bash
$ like library/hello_world.l
```
