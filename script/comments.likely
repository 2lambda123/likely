Comments
--------
**[Source Code](script/comments.likely)**

Likely supports [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Code is specified in blocks like

    x = 9
    -- This is a single line comment in a code block

or

```
y = 4*x
```

or `z = y+6`, `show(z)`. Everything not in a code block is also a comment!
