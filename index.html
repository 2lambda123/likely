    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the documentation <i>and source code</i> for <i>Likely</i> the literate kernel library!
       Simply stated, the goals of Likely are to provide image processing and machine learning functions, or <i>kernels</i>, that are:
      <ul>
        <li>executable everywhere.</li>
        <li>perfectly optimized.</li>
        <li>uncompromisingly elegant.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="executable_everywhere">Executable Everywhere</h3>
    <p>Likely is written in plain old <i>ISO C++ '98</i> and depends only on <i>LLVM</i> which means it runs <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#hardware">everywhere LLVM does</a>.
      Kernels execute natively on single CPU threads via the LLVM <i>Just-In-Time</i> (JIT) compiler, multi-core CPUs with <i>OpenMP</i>, and <i>OpenCL</i> compatible GPUs and coprocessors.
    </p>
    <h3 id="perfectly_optimized">Perfectly Optimized</h3>
    <p>Likely relies on the powerful and well established LLVM optimization passes to make kernel execution as fast as possible.
      Since compilation is held off until runtime, kernels are optimized to take advantage of all instruction set extensions available on the host processor.
      In reality, compilation is delayed until a function is called for the first time, enabling optimization opportunities that are impossible in conventional image processing libraries.
      The entire premise of Likely is hinged on the observation that for image processing applications
      <blockquote>
        <p>while kernels must be written generically to handle any matrix type, at runtime they tend to be executed repeatedly on the same type.</p>
      </blockquote>
      The repeated execution of a kernel with the same matrix type means that branching to handle different data types is unnecessary, entire loops and code blocks can be eliminated, and many values that would be runtime parameters instead become compile time constants.
      For this reason, it's not uncommon for Likely kernels to be <i>faster</i> than equally generic <tt>C</tt> code.
    </p>
    <p>In Likely, a matrix's type is referred to as its <i>hash</i>, encompassing its data type (<tt>integer</tt> or <tt>floating point</tt>), depth (<tt>8</tt>, <tt>16</tt>, <tt>32</tt>, or <tt>64</tt> bits), computation location (<tt>single-threaded CPU</tt>, <tt>OpenMP CPU</tt>, or <tt>OpenCL coprocessor</tt>), and its <tt>single-dimension</tt> axes.
      Likely functions check the input's hash against the currently compiled kernel's hash and recompile on a mismatch.
      In this way,
      <blockquote>
        <p>all the logic needed to handle different matrix types is reduced to a single 16-bit integer comparison which branch prediction can optimize out.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h3 id="uncompromisingly_elegant">Uncompromisingly Elegant</h3>
    <p>Likely is inspired by Donald Knuth's <i>literate programming</i>.
      It is a <i>literate</i> kernel library because
      <blockquote>
        <p>all the kernels documented on this webpage are also the source code for the library.</p>
      </blockquote>
      In fact, this webpage is compiled into the Likely library and parsed at runtime to extract kernel definitions.
      You can access this content for yourself with <code class="prettyprint lang-c">const char *this_webpage = likely_index_html();</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Kernels are written in <i>MathML</i> allowing them to be rendered cleanly here and parsed easily by the backend.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>The following sections discuss how to build and incorporate Likely into your own project.</p>
    <h3 id="build_instructions">Build Instructions</h3>
    <p>Likely uses the <i>CMake</i> (>= 2.8.9) build system and will automatically download and compile its LLVM dependency.</p>
    <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/biometrics/likely.git<br>$ cd likely<br>$ mkdir build<br>$ cd build<br>$ cmake ..<br>$ make -j4</pre>
    <p>Unit tests are an optional build flag whereby kernels are compared against equivalent <i>OpenCV</i> functions for correctness and speed.
      The build system will automatically download and compile OpenCV.
    </p>
    <pre>$ cmake -D BUILD_TESTING=ON ..<br>$ make -j4</pre>
    <p>Installation and packaging work as expected.</p>
    <pre>$ make install<br>$ cpack -G TGZ</pre>
    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
    <p>C/C++ projects should <code class="prettyprint lang-c">#include &lt;likely.h&gt;</code> and link against the shared library <code>likely</code>.
      <tt>FindLikely.cmake</tt> is provided as a convenience to CMake developers.
